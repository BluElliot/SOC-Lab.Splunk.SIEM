# Introduction

## Summary

This project was selected because it consolidates the majority of concepts covered during two years of study in Network and IT Security at Noroff, while also providing hands-on, practical experience that is highly valued by employers. The lab is designed as an end-to-end SOC Analyst environment focused on detection, investigation, and incident response.

## What was done

The lab incorporates a wide range of topics, including virtual machines, Active Directory domains, networking, security fundamentals, system hardening, ethical hacking techniques, and centralized monitoring and detection of security incidents.

Splunk is used as the primary SIEM platform for log ingestion, correlation, and analysis. As one of the most widely adopted SIEM solutions in industry, Splunk was chosen both for its relevance to real-world SOC operations and because it aligns with my ongoing education.

The overall design of the lab is a composite built from multiple well-established learning resources, used holistically as foundational guidance rather than copied implementations. These include structured SOC labs, detection-focused homelabs, and vendor training platforms. Unlike these sources, all practical configurations implemented in this project are properly referenced and cited throughout the work where applicable.

In addition to formal sources, community-driven resources such as technical forums, social platforms, online discussions, and video tutorials were consulted when needed to overcome hardware limitations or clarify specific implementation details. Due to their ad-hoc and exploratory nature, these sources are not formally cited unless directly relevant to a specific task.

To improve readability and learning flow, detailed configurations and troubleshooting steps were originally separated into dedicated chapters titled *Configurations* and *Problems and Solutions*. Due to word count limitations, these chapters are excluded from this submission and instead compiled in a separate appendix document, which can be provided upon request. Configuration excerpts and solutions referenced in this project are linked as images hosted externally and remain accessible during the grading period.

Entry-level configurations, such as basic installations following official documentation, are intentionally not expanded upon unless technical considerations required deviation or deeper analysis, as is the case with certain Splunk components.

## Outcome

This project was developed iteratively over an extended period, including multiple redesigns and restarts. Beyond serving as a demonstration of practical SOC Analyst skills, it is intended to function as a beginner-friendly reference for individuals seeking hands-on exposure to core SOC fundamentals.

Throughout my education at Noroff, documenting processes and troubleshooting steps has been a key learning strategy. The same methodology was applied here to reinforce understanding and retention of technical concepts.
